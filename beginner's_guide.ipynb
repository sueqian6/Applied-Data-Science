So I chose to build a foundation by reading introductory books like [Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/). It is designed for those with literally no coding experience. The most famous textbook is probably [Speech and Language Processing](https://https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book.pdf), which you can find on Github. This book doesn’t teach you how to code. It covers theories in NLP broadly. I think reading the first half carefully is enough for beginners; you can always come back to the second half in the future when you are looking for something in particular. "

So if you are interested in them, make sure to check in Albert everyday to see if the holds are lifted for students outside CDS. I’ll be grading NLU so looking forward to seeing you there.
